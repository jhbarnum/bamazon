# bamazon

## Bamazon is a store inventory program that will track product levels with the help of a mySQL database. The user can buy products using a prompt line created with the inquirer npm package.

Just tell us what you want, and how many you need.
![PickQuantity](/images/pickQuantity.png)

We will then check our inventory for the ability to fill the order request. If the inventory noted in our database is sufficient, we will fill the order. If not, we will tell you we don't have enough product to fill the order.
